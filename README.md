Image Classification using BiT
Welcome to the Image Classification using BiT repository! This repository provides an implementation of BiT (Big Transfer), a state-of-the-art image classification model developed by Google Research. BiT achieves remarkable performance on a wide range of image classification tasks.

Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to leverage the power of BiT for image classification tasks. BiT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large-scale dataset called JFT-300M, which contains a diverse range of images from the web. By fine-tuning this pre-trained model on specific classification tasks, we can achieve excellent performance with minimal training effort.
